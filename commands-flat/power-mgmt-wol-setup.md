I would like to enable wake on lan support on this computer.

Please:

- Identify my network adapter 
- Verify WOL support 

Assuming that WOL is supported:

- Ensure WOL is implemented at the software level so that the device is ready to be woken by magic packets 

also:

- See what other wake devices I have configured. I may wish to remove them in favor of magic packets/WOL
