Please conduct a LAN scan using ARP.

Subnet is 10.0.0.0/24

Let's approach this in two phases:

1: Gather the ARP report as a txt in ./arp-scan

Once we have gathered the raw data, I would like you to create a human readable report lan-scan.md

Guidelines for creating this report:

- Begin by listing the total number of devices on network  
- By referring to known hosts and known MAC patterns, attempt to groups the detected devices into groups based on their assumed type  
- Flag any suspicious devices
