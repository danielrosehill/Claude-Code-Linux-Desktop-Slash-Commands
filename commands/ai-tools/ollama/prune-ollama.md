Review the ollama models that are installed on this computer.

Your task is to prune those that I do not need to retain (but before doing so, confirm).

Pruning logic:

consider for pruning:

- Models that serve almost the same purpose and for which there is no compelling reason to keep both. Ask which I'd like to keep or suggest for deletion the slightly inferior of the two. 
- Models that are deprecated  

For example:

- If you were to find llama 3. 1 8B and llama 3.2 8B, you would reasonably suggest that I consider pruning 3.1 as it's an older model and both are quantized.
