Please:

Conduct a thorough security audit of this operating system which is a Linux desktop device.

Your tasks are as follows:

1: Basics - is this desktop running an antivirus and/or more advanced tooling like rootkit detectors. If they are installed, are they pulling definitions regularly and automatically? Are scans scheduled to run automatically and recurrently? Is there a notification process for warning the user of detected threats?

2: Firewall - is a firewall in place and if so what is the current firewall posture. Is hardening recommended?

3: File permissions - identify any potentially unsafe permissions.

4: Unsafe packages - does the user have any currently installed packages which are known to be spyware, malware, or which has received concerns from users about safety.
