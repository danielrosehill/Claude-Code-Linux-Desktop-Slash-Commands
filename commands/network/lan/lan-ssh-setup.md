I would like to set up SSH auth with other trusted devices on this network.

Let's share my public key with the devices that I identify.

I will provide a list of SSH aliases and/or LAN IPs.

For each:

- Execute ssh-copy-id 

I will authenticate with password authentication and then we can move onto the next machine.
